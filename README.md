>Connect with Software Development Mentors and Apprentices.

Code Istari helps mentors and apprentices connect in order to share knowledge. For apprentices, they get to learn from more experienced developers, and the advantage for mentors is that they get to share their knowledge with others, learn more in the process and expand their network.
